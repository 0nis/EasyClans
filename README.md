# EasyClans
Not actually published because I created this while in a hyperfocus long ago. But I might publish it later! If you still want a JAR, you can download it here: https://www.mediafire.com/file_premium/geu9sgv9nhtavfo/EasyClans-1.jar/file

Here's the explanation I published to my Discord server when I first added the plugin:

> Once you create a clan with `/clan create [name]`, you can protect your chests so that only the members in your clan and allied clans can open the chests! Simply edit the sign you normally use to protect your chests and add `[<clanName>]`. So if you've created a clan called 'test', you'd protect your chest using an added line `[test]`. 

> The way allies work works a bit differently than usual, since I kinda got lazy. Basically, you can add any clan as ally without them confirming it. You won't be *their* ally, however. To be mutual allies, both clans will have to add eachother as an ally. You can remove allies without notifying them.
Allies have 3 main functionalities:
> - To look pretty in `/clan info <clan>`
> - So that your clan + all your allies (even if they aren't mutual allies!) can access your clan chests
> - So that if you're mutual allies and both clans have friendly fire disabled, you won't be able to hurt eachother

> Each clan has their own private chat. You can chat in it by using either `/clan chat <message>` or `/cc <message>`. 
:warning: For moderation purposes, staff will be able to read these messages, so please keep private and/or sensitive information in `/msg` or in discord DMs. 

> A clan can have their own home. You can set the clan home with `/clan set home`. You must have at least 3 members in your clan to have a clan home!
You can decide whether your clan home is public or not with `/clan set home private` or `/clan set home public`. If your clan home is public, *everyone* in the server will be able to use it. Teleport to your clan home using `/clan home`. 

> For more information, execute the command `/clan help`.

Has Blocklocker, PlaceholderAPI, and DiscordSRV integration! I forgot the rest.
